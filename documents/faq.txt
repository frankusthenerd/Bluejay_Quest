FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

1. I never played Super Mario World before, am I in trouble?

    Not really. Although it will take practice for you to learn the game it shouldn't
    be too hard. The best way to learn the game is to play it.
  
2. How do pipes look like?

    They're round, silver, and shiny. You can't miss them.
  
3. What does energy do?

    Energy is your life force. You consume it whenever you fly. That's why you should eat
    a lot of berries and eggs.
  
4. How do I Bluejay to eat a berry?

    Position his beak in front of the berry (or egg) and he'll automatically eat it.
  
5. How do I start the level editor?

    At the command prompt type "bluejay -edit".
  
6. Will stomping on enemies work?

    Yes, but Bluejay's feet are small so you need to jump squarely on your enemies. It might
    be better to simply hit enemies with your tail.
  
7. What is the red number of the right of the screen?

    That's your score. It's there to see how good of a player you are?
  
8. Does the game save?

    No. You have to play through it in one sitting.
  
9. Is the game free?

    This game is free. It can be redistributed and changed but please do not take credit
    for writing it or try to sell it. That would be illegal.
  
10. How do you get extra lives?

    Eat the yellow cherries.
  
11. This game is too hard...

    Then you need to practice more.
  
12. I would like to join the project. Is that ok?

    I work alone and best alone.

13. What is the point of collecting eggs? Do I get anything besides strength?

    Yes, but that's for you to find out!

14. I lost my ability to fly! What went wrong?

    Your energy is low. I suggest looking for food right away!

15. I found a bug.

    Send it to me: lamini.1@osu.edu.

16. I came to the end of this level but can't find a way out. What's going on?

    You need to look for the exit.

17. I'm stuck and I can't fly. What should I do?

    Press D to kill yourself. This will keep you from having to restart the game and lose
    progress. Be more careful next time.

18. I'm having a hard time controlling the bird and it's becoming frustrating.

    You need to get used to the game.

19. I'm having a hard time jumping on enemies. Is something wrong?

    Nope. Due to Bluejay's small feet and the fact that he doesn't have as much control over
    his jumps as Mario you shouldn't try to stomp moving enemies unless they are large. Use
    your tail to kill grounded enemies. In the air, however, some enemies stay still or are
    slow so stomping them can be effective but you have to jump squarely on them. The tail is
    also effective but harder to use.

20. Does the game compile on Linux?

    It should but you may need to change the makefile for this to work. As for the code it can
    be compiled on Linux without having to be changed.

21. Does the game support the gamepad?

    No, not yet.

22. How many levels are in this game?

    That's for you to find out.

23. What's the story of the game?

    Bluejay's Quest is an egg hunt. Basically, look for eggs. As you get deeper into the game
    you will learn the truth.

24. Will you be developing the game any further?

    No. This game was more of an experiment for me and it taught me a lot. However, I have
    lost interest in developing this game and prefer to move onto other things. Development
    from here on is up to the hackers!

25. Why am I told not to edit level 23?

    You can edit level 23 but you cannot display a message because that message is used for
    the game's ending. Instead you should edit another level.

26. Should I use test level?

    Yes. I use them so that I can isolate objects for testing. You should use them too.
